\begin{abstract}
There are many ways to implement depth mapping for 3D vision purposes -- the two primary methods being light-based and stereoscopic. We discuss an implementation of automated stereoscopic depth mapping, including automatic corresponding point matching using corner detection and window-based feature matching. Using the matched points, we then use the distance between the matched points to determine the distance of the object from the camera. Finally, we display this depth information using a heat map. Overall, we found our implementation to be reasonably accurate, comparable to other stereoscopic depth mapping implementations. Our point matcher was also reasonably accurate, with a few false matches.
