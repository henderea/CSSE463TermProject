Overall, we were satisfied by the results of our algorithm given the time constraints of our project. Given more time, we would've been able to improve our results to some degree, but any additional improvement would be hindered by limitations of current camera technology and general limitations of stereoscopic depth mapping. 

Our point matching algorithm ended up being very similar in performance to MATLAB's, with only slight degradation as a result of being a greedy algorithm that tried to ensure that every point had a match, resulting in some matches that are far away from the starting point. Our greedy algorithm had some advantages, though -- especially in Figures \ref{fig:jp-ofc-matlab-match}-\ref{fig:jp-ofc-ours-depth}, where our algorithm found a significant number of matches while MATLAB's algorithm only found a couple of matches.
