Our project implements automated stereoscopic depth mapping in MATLAB.  We take a pair of stereoscopic images, taken at the same time by identical cameras whose backplanes are coplanar, and produce a depth map of relative distances in the form of a heat map.  Our general approach was to first obtain so-called interesting points in both images in order to obtain a subset of the image with easily identifiable features.  Then we use feature information from these points to locate corresponding points in the other image. Based on how much each point has shifted, we produce a depth map. In our current version, the depth map is limited to the points that are matched between the two images instead of a full mapping of regions.
