Our project implements automated stereoscopic depth mapping in MATLAB.  We take a pair of stereoscopic images, ideally taken by cameras located on the same plane, and produce a depth map.  In our current version, the depth map is limited to the points that are matched between the two images.  It uses a color-based depth display, with the coloring being the heat-map palate: white as the closest, yellow in the middle, and red towards the back.  The parts of the image that don't have a depth value are colored black.
