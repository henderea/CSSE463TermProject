While we had to settle for our fallback goal of creating only a partial depth map, we do believe that our approach showed some merit. Above are shown some examples of our point matching compared with MATLAB's, which uses a 11$\times$11 window as per MATLAB's documentation, and the same depth mapping applied to the results of each set. As you can see in these, our implementation compares reasonably well with MATLAB given the same corner data -- and specifically for the images used in Figures \ref{fig:jp-ofc-matlab-match}-\ref{fig:jp-ofc-ours-depth}, performed exceptionally better than MATLAB, (who actually produced no valid correlations). We assume that this is because of the assumption we make that a match point will lie within a 10-pixel band of its source, allowing us to make more forgiving matches in the case of harsher perspective shifts between the two images.

MATLAB's point correlation did tend to produce smoother depth maps for images with only minor differences however, whereas our implementation introduced substantial noise. Our algorithm also  had the tendency to make matches that went completely across the image, which we dealt with by discarding outliers above two standard deviations. However, even with this weighting, it simply turned out that these matches were the best that the algorithm could find -- likely a result of being a greedy algorithm and just matching whatever points were left over.
